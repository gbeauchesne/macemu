Bugs:
- System 7.1 with Quadra900 ModelID (1MB ROM): 0x108 gets strange value
- Real memory addressing: something is still wrong in the Unix part, though
  it works under Linux/i386
- VOSF does not work with Darwin/X11. Probably due to a combination of
  select()/signals/sigsegv handling/vm_protect()

General:
- Sony: rdVerify, Tag Buffer
- Disk: rdVerify
- CD-ROM: track lists, positioning type 3, TOC type 4/5, ReadHeader/ReadMCN/
  ReadISRC/ReadAudio/ReadAllSubcodes
- Sound output rate/bits/channels switching
- Sound in
- Video: multiple monitor support
- More accurate Time Manager
- Serial driver: XOn/XOff handshaking
- Classic ROM: mouse button/movement is broken with ROM mouse handler
- Classic ROM: sound output
- Write a nice User's Manual with linuxdoc or something similar

AmigaOS:
- "Create Hardfile..." button
- Support for ShapeShifter External Video Drivers
- Direct SCSI transfers, i.e. no buffering for contiguous transfers (can't check if
  the device supports that); buffer is always in Chip memory now
- Preemptive threads don't work?
- clip_amiga.cpp: clip AmigaOS->Basilisk
- sys_amiga.cpp: MaxTransfer/BufMemType/TransferMask, SysAddCDROMPrefs(),
  SysFormat()
- Patch 512K ROM for 68040/060 caches
- Input handler instead of IDCMP?
- Last sound buffer is not played

BeOS:
- clip_beos.cpp: clip BeOS->Basilisk
- Last sound buffer is not played

Unix:
- clip_unix.cpp: clip Unix->Basilisk
- clip_unix.cpp: use X selections instead of cut buffer
- sys_unix.cpp: SysFormat(), SysIsFixedDisk(), SysIsDiskInserted(), prevent/allow
  for non-floppy/CDROM devices
- scsi_linux.cpp: adapt to SCSI Generic driver V2.0
- ESD vs. /dev/dsp should be a prefs item
- ESD is also available on Solaris
- maybe use SDL for sound?
- serial_unix.cpp: provide a way to pipe input/output to programs
