Bugs:
<UL>
<LI>The restart button no longer works correctly. It quits the emulation, but
	then fails to restart it. This used to work in older versions (up to v6)</LI>
<LI>In window mode, if the framerate is low (<I>e.g.</I> if you leave it at the
	default of 10fps), really fast mouse clicks are sometimes not picked up
	by the Emulator. For now, click more slowly</LI>
<LI>In full screen mode, when the mouse is first moved, the emulated pointer
	jumps to the location that it was before fullscreen mode was entered.
	Disturbing, but not damaging.</LI>
</UL>
Untested:
<UL>
<LI>Mac Classic emulation. I don't have a ROM, but I suspect it will crash</LI>
<LI>Floppy stuff</LI>
<LI>Serial port code</LI>
</UL>
Unimplemented:
<UL>
<LI>CD-ROM stuff. Should be the same as any other BSD, but Apple has stupidly
    created different ioctls. I am still trying to get this to work</LI>
<LI>Ethernet</LI>
<LI>Reset and Interrupt functions for emulator</LI>
<LI>Sound</LI>
<LI>Window depth. It is currently stuck at 32bits, which Quartz dithers down
	to whatever the user's display is set to. This is mainly due to the fact
	that NSBitmapImageRep does not support any 16bit modes. The Core Graphics
	primitives, or 10.2, may allow a workaround though</LI>
<LI>'nogui' to disable GUI alerts (and maybe preferences, but I need to split
	MainMenu.nib to do that)</LI>
<LI>Better documentation. There are README, ToDo and Versions in the help menu,
    but I need to add some HowTo documents (<I>e.g.</I> How do I install the OS
    on a disk image?), perhaps in the Help menu </LI>
</UL>
Other:
<UL>
<LI>Verify that ExtFS works under 7.5.3 (reported by Kentaro Nakatani),
    update doco</LI>
</UL>
Possible Enhancements:
<UL>
<LI>Use NSFileManager's movePath:toPath:handler to rename all a file's forks
    in extfs_macosx.mm</LI>
<LI>Emulator snapshot - save the current emulator state
	(memory + registers) to a file for fast startup next time</LI>
<LI>Multiple emulators. The window stuff is mostly there,
	but the uae_cpu code has lots of globals, and is not re-entrant</LI>
<LI>Real addressing mode for the emulator.
	At the moment, OS X's mmap() call does not support anything useful</LI>
<LI>Get VOSF (Video on Seg Fault) working, to speed up screen redrawing</LI>
<LI>Implement OpenGL windowing mode (to speed up emulator screen redrawing)</LI>
<LI>Improve Objective-C object allocation. e.g. <A HREF="http://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/artikel/Optimisation/opti-5.html"> here</A>. </LI>
<LI>Use automake instead of the current 1_prepare_files.sh ?</LI>
<LI>Add JIT options to preferences.</LI>
</UL>
