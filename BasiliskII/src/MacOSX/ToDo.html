Bugs:
<UL>
<LI>The restart button no longer works correctly. It quits the emulation, but
	then fails to restart it. This used to work in older versions (up to v6)</LI>
<LI>In window mode, if the framerate is low (<I>e.g.</I> if you leave it at the
	default of 10fps), really fast mouse clicks are sometimes not picked up
	by the Emulator. For now, click more slowly</LI>
<LI>In full screen mode after a restart, when the mouse is first moved,
	the emulated pointer jumps to the location that it was before the restart.
	Disturbing, but not damaging.</LI>
<LI>Ejecting a CD only works in 10.2, and it freezes the emulation for about 5
	seconds.</LI>
</UL>
Untested:
<UL>
<LI>Mac Classic emulation. I don't have a ROM, but I suspect it will crash</LI>
<LI>Floppy stuff</LI>
<LI>Serial port code</LI>
</UL>
Unimplemented:
<UL>
<LI>CD audio stuff. I am still trying to get this to work</LI>
<LI>Ethernet</LI>
<LI>Reset and Interrupt functions for emulator</LI>
<LI>Sound</LI>
<LI>'nogui' to disable GUI alerts (and maybe preferences, but I need to split
	MainMenu.nib to do that)</LI>
<LI>Better documentation. There are README, ToDo and Versions in the help menu,
    but I need to add some HowTo documents (<I>e.g.</I> How do I install the OS
    on a disk image?), perhaps in the Help menu </LI>
</UL>
Other:
<UL>
<LI>Verify that ExtFS works under 7.5.3 (reported by Kentaro Nakatani),
    update doco</LI>
</UL>
Possible Enhancements:
<UL>
<LI>Use NSFileManager's movePath:toPath:handler to rename all a file's forks
    in extfs_macosx.mm</LI>
<LI>Emulator snapshot - save the current emulator state
	(memory + registers) to a file for fast startup next time</LI>
<LI>Multiple emulators. The window stuff is mostly there,
	but the uae_cpu code has lots of globals, and is not re-entrant</LI>
<LI>Real addressing mode for the emulator.
	At the moment, OS X's mmap() call does not support anything useful</LI>
<LI>Get VOSF (Video on Seg Fault) working, to speed up screen redrawing</LI>
<LI>Improve Objective-C object allocation. e.g. http://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/artikel/Optimisation/opti-5.html</LI>
<LI>Use automake instead of the current 1_prepare_files.sh ?</LI>
<LI>Add JIT options to preferences.</LI>
<LI>"Publish" at mac.emuscene.com http://www.emulation.net</LI>
