			How to build this source
			------------------------

1) Install the OS X Development tools

   Source should build on 10.0 thru 10.2
   (If anyone wants a version that will compile on Public Beta, email me)

2) If grabbing this source from a tarball, put this MacOSX directory in
   BasiliskII-1.0/src. The tarball is currently only compatible with the
   BasiliskII_src_15012002.tar.gz (1.0) snapshot.
   Open a Terminal, and cd to BasiliskII-1.0/src/MacOSX

3) sh 1_prepare_files.sh

   This creates some symlinks to files in the Unix source and
   /usr/libexec directories, generates ./configure, and runs it.

   The end result is a Makefile and some header files

4) make

   This should generate the uae_cpu emulator core's source,
   and then the application.

* It is also possible to use the OS X integrated development environment
  (i.e. the "Project Builder" IDE) to build the application, instead of make.
  Instead of step 4) above, do these steps:

4) make ide

   This should generate the uae_cpu emulator core's source,
   and then open the IDE with the file in BasiliskII.pbproj

5) From the Build menu, choose 'Build' or 'Build & Run'

   This should build everything



Notes:

1) Compiling cpuemu.cpp takes 58 seconds on my 384MB G4 400.
   Compiling it as separate files (cpuemu1.cpp thru cpuemu8.cpp)
   takes 68 seconds on the same machine. If you have less RAM,
   it may be faster to compile it as separate files.

2) For some reason, compiling on 10.2 with DIRECT_ADDRESSING 1
   results in an executable that cannot write to the screen.

3) If you want to change the REAL_ADDRESSING or DIRECT_ADDRESSING
   defaults in sysdeps.h, you will need to reconfigure.
   (i.e. make distclean; sh 1_prepare_files.sh)
