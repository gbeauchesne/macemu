			How to build this source
			------------------------

1) Install the OS X Development tools

   Source should build on 10.0 thru 10.2, and should be OK with 10.3
   (If anyone wants a version that will compile on Public Beta, email me)

2) Open a Terminal, and cd to BasiliskII-1.0/src/MacOSX

3) sh 1_prepare_files.sh

   This creates some symlinks to files in the Unix source and
   /usr/libexec directories, generates ./configure, and runs it.

   The end result is a Makefile and some header files

4) make

   This should generate the uae_cpu emulator core's source,
   and then the application.

* It is also possible to use the OS X integrated development environment
  (i.e. "Project Builder" or Xcode) to build the application, instead of make.
  Instead of step 4) above, do these steps:

4) make ide

   This should generate the uae_cpu emulator core's source,
   and then open the project in the Project Builder or Xcode IDE.

5) From the Build menu, choose 'Build' or 'Build & Run'

   This should build everything



Notes:

1) Compiling cpuemu.cpp takes 58 seconds on my 384MB G4 400.
   Compiling it as separate files (cpuemu1.cpp thru cpuemu8.cpp)
   takes 68 seconds on the same machine. If you have less RAM,
   it may be faster to compile it as separate files.

2) If you want to change the addressing default
   (which is currently direct), you have to reconfigure.
   (i.e. make clean; ./configure --enable-addressing=banks)

3) To emulate a Mac Classic, or any Mac with 24bit addressing,
   the app needs to be built with the above (bank) style addressing.
   This is how I build the "classic" version of the app.
