			How to build this source
			------------------------

1) Install the OS X Development tools

   Source should build on either 10.0 or 10.1
   (If anyone wants a version that will compile on Public Beta, email me)

2) If grabbing this source from a tarball, put this MacOSX directory in
   BasiliskII-1.0/src. Source is currently only compatible with 1.0 snapshot.
   Open a Terminal, and cd to BasiliskII-1.0/src/MacOSX

3) sh 1_prepare_files.sh

   This creates some symlinks to files in the Unix source and
   /usr/libexec directories, generates ./configure, and runs it.

   The end result is a Makefile and some header files

4) make

   This should generate the uae_cpu emulator core's source,
   and then the application.

* It is also possible to use the OS X integrated development environment
  (i.e. the "Project Builder" IDE) to build the application, instead of make.
  Instead of step 6) above, do this:

4) make ide

   This should generate the uae_cpu emulator core's source,
   and then open the IDE with the file in BasiliskII.pbproj

5) From the Build menu, choose 'Build' or 'Build & Run'

   This should build everything
