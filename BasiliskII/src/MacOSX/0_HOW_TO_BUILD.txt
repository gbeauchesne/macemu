			How to build this source
			------------------------

1) Install the OS X Development tools

   Source should build on either 10.0 or 10.1
   (If anyone wants a version that will compile on Public Beta, email me)

2) If grabbing this source from a tarball, put this MacOSX directory in
   BasiliskII-1.0/src. Source is currently only compatible with 1.0 snapshot.
   Open a Terminal, and cd to BasiliskII-1.0/src/MacOSX

3) sh 0prepare_links

   This creates some symlinks to files in the Unix and /usr/libexec directories

4) autoconf

   Ignore the warning. autoconf should generate ./configure

5) ./configure

   This should generate a Makefile and some header files

6) make

   This should generate the uae_cpu emulator core's source,
   and then the application.

* It is also possible to use the OS X integrated development environment
  (i.e. the "Project Builder" IDE) to build the application, instead of make.
  Instead of step 6) above, do this:

6) make ide

   This should generate the uae_cpu emulator core's source,
   and then open the IDE with the file in BasiliskII.pbproj

7) From the Build menu, choose 'Build' or 'Build & Run'

   This should build everything



* There is one file in the source, cpuemu.cpp, which takes _ages_ to
  compile, particularly if optimisation is on. The Unix source splits the
  file into 8 smaller parts to compile separately, but I didn't find that
  really helped on OS X. Basically, you just have to be patient.
