The Xcode SheepShaver project makes it easier to build SheepShaver as a
Universal Binary (with 3 architectures: i386, x86_64 and ppc).

This is an optional build system that does not affect the existing
autogen/configure based build system, which is still fully supported.
The Xcode project will build SheepShaver with configuration
"--enable-sdl-audio --enable-sdl-video --disable-vosf".

The Xcode project lives in has been tested to work on Snow Leopard
64-bit with Xcode 3.2.6 and the 10.4 SDK installed. It may not work
under newer versions of Xcode or Mac OS X.

To use it, you need the following:

1. A complete 'macemu' git checkout of SheepShaver and BasiliskII.
2. SDL installed as a framework in /Library/Frameworks/SDL.framework.
3. You do not need to run autogen.sh / configure to use the Xcode
project. If you've done so already, you should remove or temporarily
move/rename src/Unix/config.h, as the presence of that file currently
conflicts with the Xcode build and will cause errors in Xcode.

With the above all set, you should be able to launch the Xcode project
and build SheepShaver, resulting in a UB build containing SDL as a
private framework in the bundle. The result will be located in either
SheepShaver/src/MacOSX/build/Debug or SheepShaver/src/MacOSX/build/Release
directories, depending if you do a Debug or Release build.
